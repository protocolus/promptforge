# issue_watcher.sh - Watches for new GitHub issues and runs Claude Code analysis
# 
# This script continuously monitors the GitHub repository for new issues that haven't
# been analyzed yet, then runs Claude Code (via 'clide' alias) to analyze each issue.
# 
# The script will:
# 1. Check for issues without the "claude-analyzed" label every 60 seconds
# 2. For each new issue, create a detailed analysis prompt
# 3. Run clide (Claude Code) to analyze the issue
# 4. Save the analysis output to a markdown file
# 5. Mark the issue as analyzed to prevent re-processing

# Configuration - the GitHub repository to monitor
REPO="protocolus/promptforge"

# The prompt template that will be sent to Claude Code for issue analysis
CLAUDE_PROMPT="Please analyze this GitHub issue and perform the following tasks:

## STEP 1: Issue Classification
First, classify this issue into one of these categories:
- bug: Software defect or error that needs fixing
- enhancement: New feature or improvement request
- question: Question or help request
- documentation: Documentation improvement needed
- maintenance: Code cleanup, refactoring, or maintenance task

## STEP 2: GitHub Labeling
Based on your classification, suggest appropriate GitHub labels that should be added to this issue. Consider:
- Issue type (bug, enhancement, question, documentation, maintenance)
- Priority level (high, medium, low)
- Complexity (easy, moderate, complex)
- Component affected (frontend, backend, database, etc.)

## STEP 3: Detailed Analysis
Provide:
1. **Issue Summary**: Brief description of what this issue is about
2. **Impact Assessment**: How this affects users or the system
3. **Priority Justification**: Why you assigned this priority level
4. **Complexity Estimate**: Technical difficulty and time investment

## STEP 4: Implementation Plan
Create a detailed plan with:
1. **Prerequisites**: What needs to be done first
2. **Step-by-step approach**: Numbered list of implementation steps
3. **Files likely to be modified**: List of files that may need changes
4. **Testing strategy**: How to verify the solution works
5. **Potential risks**: What could go wrong during implementation

## STEP 5: Questions and Clarifications
List any questions that need clarification from the issue author before work can begin.

Please format your response in clear markdown sections."

GitHub Issue Watcher Script
===========================

This script monitors the protocolus/promptforge repository for new GitHub issues
and automatically runs Claude Code analysis on each new issue found.

Usage: $0 [options]

Options:
  -h, --help    Show this help message

Requirements:
  - GitHub CLI (gh) installed and authenticated with 'gh auth login'
  - jq installed for JSON processing
  - claude CLI installed with -p (headless) flag support

How it works:
1. Continuously checks for issues without the "clide-analyzed" label
2. For each new issue found:
   - Downloads the full issue content
   - Creates a detailed analysis prompt
   - Runs claude -p (Claude in headless mode) to analyze the issue
   - Saves analysis to issues/issue_[number]_analysis.md
   - Automatically applies suggested GitHub labels
   - Posts analysis as a comment on the GitHub issue
   - Marks issue with "clide-analyzed" label to prevent re-processing

Output files:
  - Analysis results saved in: issues/issue_[number]_analysis.md
  - Colored terminal output with timestamps
  - Automatic GitHub label application based on analysis
  - Analysis posted as comments on GitHub issues

To stop the watcher: Press Ctrl+C
