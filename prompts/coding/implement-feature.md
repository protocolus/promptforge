I need to implement a new feature in my codebase. Please help me:

1. **Analyze the requirements** and break down the implementation into smaller tasks
2. **Design the solution** following best practices and existing code patterns
3. **Write the code** with proper error handling and validation
4. **Add appropriate tests** to ensure the feature works correctly
5. **Update documentation** if needed

**Feature Description:**
[Describe what the feature should do]

**Acceptance Criteria:**
[List the requirements the feature must meet]

**Existing Codebase Context:**
[Provide relevant code or describe the current architecture]

Please follow the existing code style and patterns in my project.
