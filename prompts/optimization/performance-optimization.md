Help me optimize my code for better performance, scalability, and efficiency.

**Code to Optimize:**
```
[Paste your code here]
```

**Performance Issues:**
- [ ] Slow response times
- [ ] High memory usage
- [ ] CPU bottlenecks
- [ ] Database query performance
- [ ] Network latency
- [ ] Rendering performance (frontend)
- [ ] Large bundle sizes
- [ ] Memory leaks

**Current Performance Metrics:**
- **Response Time:** [Current vs Target]
- **Memory Usage:** [Current vs Target]
- **CPU Usage:** [Current vs Target]
- **Database Queries:** [Count and timing]
- **Bundle Size:** [Current size]

**System Context:**
- **Language/Framework:** [Specify]
- **Database:** [Type and size]
- **Infrastructure:** [Hosting environment]
- **User Load:** [Expected concurrent users]

**Profiling Data:**
[Include any profiling results or performance monitoring data]

**Optimization Constraints:**
- [ ] Must maintain current functionality
- [ ] Limited memory available
- [ ] Specific latency requirements
- [ ] Budget constraints
- [ ] Compatibility requirements

Please help me:
1. **Identify performance bottlenecks** through code analysis
2. **Provide specific optimization strategies** with code examples
3. **Suggest algorithmic improvements** where applicable
4. **Optimize database queries** and data access patterns
5. **Implement caching strategies** where beneficial
6. **Reduce memory usage** and prevent leaks
7. **Set up performance monitoring** to track improvements
8. **Create performance benchmarks** to measure success
