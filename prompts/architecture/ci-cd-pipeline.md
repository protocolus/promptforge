Help me design and implement a robust CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.

**Project Details:**
- **Application Type:** [Web app, API, mobile, desktop]
- **Technology Stack:** [Languages, frameworks, databases]
- **Repository:** [GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Azure DevOps]
- **Deployment Target:** [AWS, Azure, GCP, on-premise, containers]

**Current Deployment Process:**
[Describe how you currently deploy your application]

**Pipeline Requirements:**
- [ ] Automated testing (unit, integration, e2e)
- [ ] Code quality checks (linting, security scans)
- [ ] Build artifact creation
- [ ] Multiple environment deployments
- [ ] Database migrations
- [ ] Blue-green or canary deployments
- [ ] Rollback capabilities
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting

**Environments:**
- [ ] Development
- [ ] Testing/QA
- [ ] Staging
- [ ] Production
- [ ] Feature environments

**Testing Strategy:**
- **Unit Tests:** [Framework and coverage requirements]
- **Integration Tests:** [Scope and tools]
- **E2E Tests:** [Browser testing, API testing]
- **Performance Tests:** [Load testing requirements]
- **Security Tests:** [SAST, DAST, dependency scanning]

**Deployment Strategy:**
- [ ] Rolling deployments
- [ ] Blue-green deployments
- [ ] Canary releases
- [ ] Feature flags
- [ ] Immediate rollback capability

**Monitoring Requirements:**
- [ ] Application performance monitoring
- [ ] Error tracking and alerting
- [ ] Infrastructure monitoring
- [ ] Log aggregation
- [ ] Business metrics tracking

Please help me:
1. **Design CI/CD pipeline** with appropriate stages and gates
2. **Set up automated testing** at each pipeline stage
3. **Configure code quality** and security scanning
4. **Implement deployment strategies** for safe releases
5. **Set up monitoring and alerting** for pipeline and applications
6. **Create rollback procedures** for failed deployments
7. **Document pipeline configuration** and troubleshooting
8. **Optimize pipeline performance** and reliability
