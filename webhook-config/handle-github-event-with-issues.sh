CLAUDE_PROMPT="Please analyze this GitHub issue and perform the following tasks:

## STEP 0: Viability Check
First, determine if this issue represents a sensible and constructive request:
- Is the request technically feasible and aligned with the project's goals?
- Does it represent a legitimate bug, enhancement, or question?
- Is it spam, nonsensical, harmful, or a bad idea for the project?

If the issue is NOT viable (spam, nonsensical, harmful, or a bad idea):
- Clearly state: **RECOMMENDATION: CLOSE ISSUE**
- Explain why this issue should be closed
- Suggest the 'wontfix' or 'invalid' label as appropriate
- Be polite but firm in the explanation

If the issue IS viable, continue with the full analysis:

## STEP 1: Issue Classification
Classify this issue into one of these categories:
- bug: Software defect or error that needs fixing
- enhancement: New feature or improvement request
- question: Question or help request
- documentation: Documentation improvement needed
- maintenance: Code cleanup, refactoring, or maintenance task

## STEP 2: GitHub Labeling
Based on your classification, suggest appropriate GitHub labels that should be added to this issue. Consider:
- Issue type (bug, enhancement, question, documentation, maintenance)
- Priority level (high, medium, low)
- Complexity (easy, moderate, complex)
- Component affected (frontend, backend, database, etc.)
- Special labels (wontfix, invalid) if the issue should be closed

## STEP 3: Detailed Analysis
Provide:
1. **Issue Summary**: Brief description of what this issue is about
2. **Impact Assessment**: How this affects users or the system
3. **Priority Justification**: Why you assigned this priority level
4. **Complexity Estimate**: Technical difficulty and time investment

## STEP 4: Implementation Plan
Create a detailed plan with:
1. **Prerequisites**: What needs to be done first
2. **Step-by-step approach**: Numbered list of implementation steps
3. **Files likely to be modified**: List of files that may need changes
4. **Testing strategy**: How to verify the solution works
5. **Potential risks**: What could go wrong during implementation

## STEP 5: Questions and Clarifications
List any questions that need clarification from the issue author before work can begin.

Please format your response in clear markdown sections."
