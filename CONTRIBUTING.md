# Contributing to PromptForge

We love your input! We want to make contributing to PromptForge as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Development Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm run install:all
   ```

2. Initialize the database:
   ```bash
   npm run init-db
   ```

3. Start development servers:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Make your changes and test thoroughly

## Any contributions you make will be under the ISC Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [ISC License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/isc/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using GitHub's [issue tracker](https://github.com/protocolus/promptforge/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/protocolus/promptforge/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

* 2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
* Use semicolons
* Use ES6+ features where appropriate
* Follow existing code patterns

## License
